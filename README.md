# üéØ Project Title: Text Emotion Detection using NLP

## üß† Overview
This project aims to detect emotions (such as joy, anger, sadness, etc.) from short English texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It is useful for analyzing customer reviews, tweets, or chat messages.

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Name**: Emotion Dataset (manually labeled)
- **Size**: ~3,000 text samples
- **Features**: `Text`, `Emotion`
